# Day 3: Development Tasks Building a popular website

## Review

- Agile, Kanban: ‘unblock’ team daily, small task sizes, pick your task

- HTML: Foundation / structure behind a page’s elements

- CSS: Layout (position + style) of the page’s elements

- Responsive Design: One flexible layout for many devices

- Mobile-first: Design mobile site first, then add full-site elements

- You only become a solid developer by coding, a lot.

## PSD to HTML/CSS

A client expects to see little to no difference between a picture of a layout and the implemented layout.

Examples: 

[Picture 1 - Before](layout\files\mobilelayout.jpg) vs [Picture 1 - After](layout\files\mobilelayout.jpg)

[Picture 2 - Before](layout\files\Picture2 before.jpg) vs [Picture 2 - After](layout\files\fullsize-content.jpg)

## Pair programming

“Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. […] 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in quality.” 				- extremeprogramming.org
